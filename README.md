### Yoon Kim
Hello, my full name is Kyungyoon Kim, but it's kinda hard to pronounce, so you can call me Yoon!
Iâ€™m currently working for [TelCuOn](https://www.telcuon.com) as Full-stack developer in South Korea.

### My langauge
I think `Koltin` is the most useful langauge now.

### I'm currently interested in...
These days, I'm learning `Vue.js`.
